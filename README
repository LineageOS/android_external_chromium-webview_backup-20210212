Building the Chromium-based WebView in AOSP is no longer supported. WebView can
now be built entirely from the Chromium source code.

General instructions for building WebView from Chromium:
https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/build-instructions-android-webview

------

The prebuilt libwebviewchromium.so included in these APKs is built from Chromium
release tag 67.0.3396.87, using the GN build tool. To match our build settings, set:

target_os="android"
is_debug=false
is_official_build=true
is_chrome_branded=false
use_official_google_api_keys=false
enable_resource_whitelist_generation=true
ffmpeg_branding="Chrome"
proprietary_codecs=true
enable_remoting=true
is_component_build=false
enable_nacl=false
remove_webcore_debug_symbols=true
android_default_version_name=67.0.3396.87
android_default_version_code=3396087$$

$$ depends on device ARCH

in your GN argument file before building.

Extra patches:
patches/chromium-theme-color.patch: Provides a callback when a theme color is set by the page

MIPS WebView:
 - The MIPS WebView requires is_clang to be set to true, since the -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks flag is not supported in gcc for MIPS.
 - At Chromium release 67.0.3396.87, third_party/crashpad/crashpad needs an update from the [upstream](https://chromium.googlesource.com/crashpad/crashpad/)
   master branch (commit 42b57efa554a47745cb84860ead46bc9f32b77a9 for the current build) to restore MIPS support.
